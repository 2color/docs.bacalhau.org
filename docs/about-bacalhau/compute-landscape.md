# Compute Over Data - Landscape Analysis

This page is an introduction to a landscape analysis of general-purpose compute frameworks.
Its purpose is to map the roughness of the existing technologies and serve as a background intro for those who are new to the Bacalhau community.

Feel free to watch the video below for a short walk-through and read the sections below. 
More content is available on the [full slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit?usp=sharing) and in the [code repository](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks), where you'll find:

* Description of each technology and how their're positioned in the compute space
* A collection of code samples to showcase and compare their APIs
* A performance benchmark to compare how they behave in processing a large  dataset

> The past can hurt. But the way I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it. - *Walt Disney*

Ultimately Bacalhau aims at combining efficient distributed computation with ease of use, and to achieve that we shall learn from the past.

## Compute Landscape

The traditional compute landscape counts several dozens of frameworks capable of processing generic workloads.
Some are specifically designed to take advantage of data locality by bringing the computation close to where data lives.
This landscape analysis reviewed a selection of these tools in order to summarize their pros and cons.

> The [full slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit?usp=sharing) contains a detailed overview of the compute frameworks and include sample code snippets. 

![Compute Framework Analysis](images/landscape.png)

The Python data stack includes tools like Pandas and Dask that offer a very convenient data structure named [Dataframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataframe), particularly suitable for handling tabular data.

The database world offers a variety of choices optimized for different use cases (e.g. tabular data, real-time time series, etc.).
This research looked at Postgres and Snowflake, a couple of fairly generic tools in this space.

Big data tools like Apache Spark and Hadoop are also part of this analysis.
They are capable of processing structured and unstructured data in very large clusters.
This category introduced first the concept of data-locality to avoid data transfers over the cluster network.

Last but not least some web3 tools are also part of this analysis.
They aim at supporting distributed storage and computation. 
Note that at the time of writing they're under heavy development. 
In many cases, it's still unclear how they work and what direction they'll take in the future.

Unfortunately, many of these systems are far from being easy to operate on your localhost or at scale.
Traditional frameworks are plagued by significant operational overhead resulting in inefficient resource usage.
Moreover, there's often a significant setup burden even to running a getting started guide, setting a relatively high barrier to entry.

The table below summarizes their score in terms of different requirements.
That rating is based on the experience of setting up and running the code described in the next section, find more details on the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g11f8b483676_0_87).

Why is Bachalau not on this list?

This analysis is not a direct comparison between Bacalhau and existing frameworks.
Instead, this research aims at helping the Bacalhau community to learn the benefits and drawbacks of traditional systems.

## Code repository

### Sample code

A good starting point to navigate the compute waters is taking a look at the [code repository](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks) where you'll find working examples of embarrassingly parallel workloads (e.g. [word count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count) , dataset aggregation, etc.).
Take a look at the dedicated folder for viewing the demos in a notebook format, no installation is needed.
Alternatively, you find the collection of examples on the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g122e31b6546_0_0).

It's informative to compare the verbosity and complexity between APIs.
For example, implementing a simple [word count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count) job [in Pandas](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks/blob/main/sample-code/word-count/pandas.ipynb) is concise and can be achieved just by chaining methods, while [the Hadoop implementation](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks/blob/main/sample-code/word-count/hadoop.ipynb) is far less intuitive, mainly because it's bound to use [the Map-Reduce paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce).


[Setup instructions](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks#sample-code) guide you through the installation process in case you'd like to run the examples yourself, and please give it a try to get an idea of how a simple single-node setup work.

### Benchmarks

The [code repository](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks) ships also benchmark scripts that run a parallel workload on a large dataset, time its execution, and log resource usage. 
Explore the related section to familiarize yourself with the rough edges of [the installation process](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks#benchmarks).

You can choose to spawn either a [single-node](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks/blob/main/installation/SINGLE-NODE.md) or [multi-node](https://github.com/winderai/bacalhau-landscape-analysis-benchmarks/blob/main/installation/MULTI-NODE.md) cluster.
Trying out *both* options is particoularly instructive for a firsthand experience with the local-to-cluster hurdles, as well as facing the complexities in installing a  framework such as Hadoop.

The benchmarked task is a [word count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count) job processing a dataset containing +1.7B words.
The plot below reports the benchmark running time for each framework, a missing bar imply that the tool doesn't support a fully-fledged multi-node set-up (i.e can only scale vertically).
Performance across the landscape can vary 10x, that's expected because Pandas is not a big-data tool, and Hadoop was not really designed to perform well on a single-node setup.
However, it's surprising that only Spark and Snowflake provide a quite easy setup combined with quick processing and very low resource usage.

## Key findings

General

* Modern frameworks must be intuitive, canâ€™t impose a byzantine approach like [MapReduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) (see Hadoop). High-level API is a must.
* Installation is often a hurdle, must be stripped down to allow anyone to complete a getting-started.
* Declarative pipelines are not quite a thing in these technologies.
* Support for repeatable containerized jobs is needed. All frameworks don't provide an effective way to package dependencies ([see Spark/Hadoop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g13641fb0d49_8_0)).
* The [local to multi-node cluster journey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g11c07429d0d_0_1178) is quite rough and requires additional installations, configurations and a different approach to writing your code. This must be overcome going forward.

Benchmark

* In Multi-node setups you may need to [optimize the cluster size](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g13641fb0d49_8_6), which is a bummer (see Dask, Hadoop)
* Tested vanilla configurations: tweaking knobs improves performance but adds complexity. Modern tools must provide out of the box experience ([see Snowflake setup](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit#slide=id.g11cf604b99b_0_236)).
* Except for Spark, these tools have poor performance with unsharded large files (i.e. strive to parallelize), thus a real life use case will require additional data preparation upstream.
* Good to keep in mind these tools are optimized to tackle different use-cases and a different task may vary results. Anyway some strive to be as generic as possible (see Spark, Dask).

# Vision (Why Bacalhau?)

Goals: Open, Collaborative Compute Ecosystem

Bacalhau was created to bring useful Compute to data stored in Filecoin. The same benefits of open collaboration on datasets stored in IPFS and Filecoin should be available to generic compute tasks.

Initially, the Bacalhau project will focus on serving data processing and analytics use cases. Over time Bacalhau will expand to other compute workloads.

Some background information behind Bacalhau come from a survey of exisisting compute frameworks, where we analyised pearls and pitfalls of web2 tecnologies.
Check out [this repository](https://gitlab.com/WinderAI/protocol-labs/sample-code-benchmark) for working code samples and benchmarks, or head to [this slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wOh-ASGshgc1Ivkoyaz9zGpVGTxX9LDMZQB4-eXOBP4/edit?usp=sharing) for a detailed summary of our findings and learnings.

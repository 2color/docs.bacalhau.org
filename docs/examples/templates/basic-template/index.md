# Title of Example

This notebook is a basic example of using notebooks to create examples. It demonstrates some of ipython's basic features to achieve common Bacalhau tasks. Other more advanced templates are available in the [templates](../templates) directory.

### Why a Notebook?

Notebooks are great because:

* Readers can "execute" the documentation. They can not only read the example, but try it!
* They are testable. We can run the notebook in CI and check that it works.
* They are interactive. Readers can alter the notebooks and play with the code.
* They are great for hackathons. Just point people to the notebook and get hacking.

### What Happens to This Notebook

There are a few CI scripts that operate on notebooks:
* Whenever you push to the main branch on this repository, a github action will automatically render your ipynb's into markdown and push them to the [docs repository](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/docs.bacalhau.org/).
* Whenever you push, pytest will run to ensure that all notebooks execute without error.

### Key Requirements

* We use Python as the kernel for our notebooks. This is the most common kernel and is used in our tests.
* Large datafiles should not be stored in the repo. Store data in either the GCS bucket or IPFS (depending on the example).
* Make sure all cells run successfully to pass tests. If a cell takes a very long time you may want to skip tests. See below.

### Structure

All examples must exist within a directory. The notebook should be called `index.ipynb` (so that it gets rendered as the index.html page in the docs). You may have other supporting files in the directory. For example:

```
basic-template
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ example-image.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ipynb
â””â”€â”€ small-toy-dataset.csv
```

### Metadata

You can control some elements of the documentation rendering by adding metadata to the notebook. This is done by adding a raw cell at the top of the notebook. The metadata is in YAML format. See the top of this file for an example.

## Working With Bash

The following demonstrates how to work with bash commands in a notebook. Note that these commands execute within the context of your kernel. If you don't have the required dependencies installed, you will need to install them first. Read more about [working with bash in notebooks](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-bash).

```bash


```bash
%%bash
echo "This is one way of working with bash, which is good because it renders nicely in the documentation"
ls -l
```

## Working with Bacalhau

> Remember that the user's and CI context likely won't have Bacalhau installed, so you need to install it.

Install Bacalhau with the following command:


```bash
%%bash
(export BACALHAU_INSTALL_DIR=.; curl -sL https://get.bacalhau.org/install.sh | bash)
```

    Note that bash is executed in a subprocess, so variables are only available within the same cell



```python
print("We can also do this with Python")
job_id = !bacalhau docker run --wait --wait-timeout-secs 100 ubuntu echo Hello World

```

    We can also do this with Python



```python
print("Which does work across cells", job_id[0])
```

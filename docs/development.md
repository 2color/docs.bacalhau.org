# Development

You can run a stand-alone Bacalhau + IPFS network on your laptop with the following guide.

The easiest way to spin up bacalhau and run a fully local demo is to use the devstack command. Please see [Running Locally](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/blob/main/docs/running_locally.md) for instructions.
